## 🚨 Important Notice: Branch Usage & Code Push Guidelines

### Dear Project Group Members,

Please **do not push any code to the `main` branch until _19-12-2025, 1:00 PM_**.
This restriction is required to maintain project stability and avoid conflicts.

### 🔀 Branch Usage Rules

If you need to push code, please use one of the following branches:

- `testing`
- `development`

⚠️ Unmanaged or frequent pushes to these branches can make the project difficult to manage. Please push only when necessary and ensure your code is tested.
